# time to location scraper
a script that should get the time to a given location from google repeatedly and then update a local web page to reflect the average time 

This script is not yet completed and, in it's current state, will not work

to run the script in its current state you will need

node.js

npm

to be attempting to run this on a linux operating system (probably, i havent actually tested this on windows yet...)
